# TicTacToe-Game
* The game consists of two players in which they seek in alternate turns to complete a row, a column, or a diagonal with either three O's or three X's placed in the spaces of a grid of nine squares. Each space will be represented as a slot with a number to indicate which slot will be played.
* Tester file to run the game (main):

# What I Learned

* Use numbers as characters with a char array.
* Assign symbols to the empty spaces.
